# Module 6 – Showcase & Wrap-Up

This final module gives you the chance to **apply everything you’ve learned** in the workshop, 
share results with others, and reflect on how Agentic AI can be used in real-world scenarios.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Recap the journey from Hello World → Tools → RAO loop → CLI packaging → Travel Planner.  
- Showcase your agent in action with prompts of your choice.  
- Reflect on learnings and discuss potential applications.  
- Provide feedback to improve future workshops.

## 🕒 Activities (30 minutes)

### 1. Recap (5 minutes)
- Quickly review the key steps you’ve gone through:
  - Installing tools and running Hello World.  
  - Building tools (weather, wiki, calculator, etc.).  
  - Creating the Reason–Act–Observe loop.  
  - Packaging into a CLI with options and extensions.  
  - Building the Travel Planner agent.  

### 2. Showcase (15 minutes)
- Run your agent live and share results with others.  
- You can use the **Travel Planner agent** or extend it with new tools.  
- Try prompts like:
  - “Plan a 4-day family trip to Tokyo.”  
  - “Give me news about climate change and summarize it in Filipino.”  
  - “Compare weather in London and New York, then translate the result to French.”  
  - “Plan a 2-day weekend food tour in Cebu.”  

### 3. Reflection & Discussion (5 minutes)
Discuss with the group or note for yourself:
- What part of building the agent was most exciting?  
- Did anything surprise you in the outputs?  
- What real-world problems could Agentic AI help solve in your context (school, work, hobbies)?  

### 4. Feedback & Closing (5 minutes)
- Fill out a short feedback form (e.g., Google Form or provided template).  
- Share what you enjoyed and what you’d like to learn more about.  
- Take note of key workshop links (GitHub repo, slides, extra resources).
