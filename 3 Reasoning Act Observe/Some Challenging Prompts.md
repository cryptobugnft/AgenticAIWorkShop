# 🎮 Sample Inputs for `planner_agent.py`

These inputs are designed to make the core RAO agent loop multiple times, often requiring 3–7+ tool calls before finalizing.

## 10 Challenging Prompts

1. **Average temperatures**  
   “What’s the average temperature of Tokyo, London, and Sydney today, and explain if it’s hotter in Asia or Europe?”

2. **Biography + math**  
   “Tell me who Jose Rizal is, then compute how many years he lived if he was born in 1861 and died in 1896.”

3. **Math + weather**  
   “What’s the sum of 23.45, 12.5, and the temperature in Manila right now?”

4. **Compare cities**  
   “Which city is warmer today, New York or London? Show me the difference in °C.”

5. **Wiki + weather + math**  
   “Tell me about Mount Mayon, then tell me the result of multiplying 15.2 by the current temperature in Tokyo.”

6. **Square a sum**  
   “What is the square of the sum of 8.75 and the temperature in Singapore right now?”

7. **Check against threshold**  
   “Get me the current temp in Sydney, then calculate its difference with 30, and tell me if Sydney is colder or hotter than 30°C.”

8. **Atlantic comparison**  
   “Find out the current temperature in London and New York, average them, then explain which side of the Atlantic is warmer.”

9. **Wiki + weather + math**  
   “Tell me about Python (the programming language), then add 42 to the current temperature in Manila and explain why it’s funny.”

10. **Multi-city math**  
   “Calculate the total of 12.5 + 8.75 + current temperature in Tokyo + current temperature in Singapore.”
